3.right join - returns common rows b/n tables + non mathching row from right table
4.full join - rows common + rows from left + rows from right.
5.cross join - 

create table department(mst_dept_id number primary key, dep_name varchar2(20));

insert into department values(1,'hr');
insert into department values(2,'admin');
insert into department values(3,'payroll');
insert into department values(4,'hr');



create table employee(mst_emp_id number primary key, emp_name varchar2(20), gender varchar2(10),salary float,
dept_id number,
constraints fk_employee_department foreign key(dept_id) references department(mst_dept_id));
